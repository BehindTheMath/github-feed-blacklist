# gh-feed-filter

**gh-feed-filter** is a Chrome extension to filter GitHub's homepage feed.

Get [gh-feed-filter](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gh-feed-filter/bkblgjbgnaleblncknpeikiipmccijcn) from the Google Chrome Webstore!

### Disclaimer

- I didn't want to handle the setup and boilerplate so I took the first thing I found and used it. It's a yeoman generator, it works nicely but all dependencies are outdated.
- PR most welcome! Don't be afraid :)

### What does it do

- It adds an icon next to the other extensions' icons.
- Clicking it lets you add the names of the repo you'd like to filter.
- Once you added some repos, the empty star means it'll get filtered out, you can toggle this behaviour by clicking on the icon.
- Same goes with the funny fork symbol.

### Next steps

- Any ideas? Open an issue!
